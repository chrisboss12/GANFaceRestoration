# Low-Quality Facial Image Restoration using Generative Model

This project aims to restore low-quality facial images using a generative model. The goal is to enhance the quality of facial images that have been degraded due to various factors such as compression artifacts, low resolution, or noise. The restoration process involves training a generative model on a dataset of high-quality facial images and then using the trained model to generate high-quality versions of low-quality input images.

## Introduction

Low-quality facial images are common in scenarios such as surveillance footage, video calls, or old photographs. Restoring these images can be challenging due to the loss of important facial details. This project leverages generative models, specifically a conditional GAN, to restore facial images by learning the underlying patterns and structures from a dataset of high-quality facial images.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/low-quality-facial-restoration.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare your dataset (see next section).
4. Train the generative model (see training section).
5. Evaluate the model's performance and generate high-quality images.
6. Use the trained model to restore low-quality facial images in your own applications.

## Dataset

The success of the restoration process depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset used for training. It is recommended to use a large and diverse dataset of high-quality facial images. Some popular choices include the CelebA dataset, the LFW dataset, or the FFHQ dataset. Make sure to pre-process the dataset, including resizing, cropping, and normalization, as necessary.

## Model Architecture

The generative model used in this project is based on a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). It consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator takes low-quality facial images as input and generates corresponding high-quality facial images. The discriminator aims to distinguish between the generated high-quality images and real high-quality images. Both the generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in an adversarial manner.

The generator architecture includes several convolutional layers for feature extraction and upsampling layers for image generation. The discriminator architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers for classification. Refer to the source code for detailed model architecture and hyperparameters.

## Training

To train the generative model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and organize it in a specific directory structure.
2. Set the desired hyperparameters in the training script.
3. Run the training script: `python train.py`

During training, the model will optimize the generator and discriminator networks using adversarial loss and additional loss functions such as L1 loss. The training process can be time-consuming, depending on the dataset size, model complexity, and available hardware resources.

## Evaluation

After training the model, it is essential to evaluate its performance. The evaluation can include metrics such as PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), or perceptual metrics like FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance). These metrics provide quantitative measures of the model's ability to restore low-quality facial images. Additionally, qualitative evaluation can be done by visually comparing the restored images with the ground truth high-quality images.
